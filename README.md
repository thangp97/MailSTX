# 📬 MailSTX – Web3 Mail dApp on Stacks

## 📜 Project Description

**MailSTX** is a decentralized Web3 mail application built on the **Stacks blockchain**, enabling users to send on-chain messages to other STX wallet addresses. It provides a censorship-resistant, incentivized communication channel between blockchain participants.

Each message is stored immutably on-chain, and every mail transaction includes a small STX fee, which contributes to a community reward pool. Once the pool reaches a set threshold, one of the senders is randomly selected to win the entire prize — making communication both purposeful and rewarding.

## 🔭 Project Vision

The vision of MailSTX is to **redefine on-chain communication** by combining transparency, economic incentives, and decentralization. Our goals include:

* Enable a Web3-native method of messaging that’s verifiable, immutable, and accessible to all STX wallet holders.
* Create economic disincentives for spam via mail fees, while rewarding meaningful participation.
* Inspire innovation in user-to-user blockchain interactions, going beyond simple token transfers.

## ⭐ Key Features

* ✉️ **Send Mail On-Chain:** Users can send a message to any valid STX wallet. The content is stored on the blockchain and cannot be altered or censored.
* 💸 **Fee per Mail:** Every mail sent requires a fee in STX (e.g., 1 STX/mail), disincentivizing spam and encouraging thoughtful communication.
* 🎁 **Prize Pool Incentive:** All senders contribute to a shared "Prize Pool". Once the pool reaches a target (e.g., 100 STX), one random sender wins the entire amount.
* 📥 **Inbox & Outbox:** Each user can view:
  * **Inbox:** All messages received from other wallets.
  * **Outbox:** All messages they've sent, along with status and timestamps.
* 🔐 **On-chain Data & Fair Selection:** All state (messages, fees, participants, pool amount) is stored and handled fully on-chain for transparency and fairness.

## 🚀 Future Scope

* 🖥️ **Frontend Integration:** Build a seamless UI with React + Stacks.js to send and view messages easily.
* 🛎️ **Push Notifications:** Add optional wallet-linked email or web notifications when new mail is received.
* 🖼️ **NFT Mail Wrappers:** Allow users to mint their message as an NFT (e.g., proof-of-message or commemorative communication).
* 🧪 **Contract Testing & Auditing:** Extend test coverage and pursue formal security audits to ensure safe deployment.
* 🌐 **DAO-based Governance:** Let users vote on prize pool thresholds, fee amounts, or message limits via on-chain governance.
* 🤝 **Inter-wallet Protocols:** Explore integration with other Stacks-based dApps or wallet messaging standards.
